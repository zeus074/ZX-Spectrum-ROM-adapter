# ZX-Spectrum-ROM-adapter
A new way to replace the ZX Spectrum ROM without modifying the motherboard.

With this simple adapter, you can install a 27C256 in place of the original 128 ROM, allowing two ROM images to be stored in the memory.

This means you can use both the original ROM and a diagnostic ROM in the same chip, and select between them using a switch.

**Construction:**

The build is simple. First, solder the passive components such as diodes and resistors. Then solder the headers for connection to the motherboard.

Finally, solder the EPROM directly, without using a socket.
 
There is very little space under the keyboard, and using a socket would raise the EPROM too high, making it impossible to close the case.
